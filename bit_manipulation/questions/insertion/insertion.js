* Insertion
*
* You are given two 32-bit numbers. N and M, and two bit positions, i and j.
* Write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends ar bit i.
* You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. That is,
* if M = 10011, you can assume that there at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not,
* for example, have j = 3 and i = 2, because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.
*
* Example:
*
* Input: N = 10000000000, M = 10011, i = 2, j = 6
* Output: N = 10001001100
*
* Solution:
