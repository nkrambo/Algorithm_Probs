##Bits

At a deep level, your computer works with bitsâ€”1s and 0s. But these get bundled
up into more human readable things, like characters and arrays. This is called **abstraction**.

While abstractions are nice, sometimes we want to work directly with bits. You can
do this with **bit manipulation**, which involves **bitwise operations**.

Bitwise operations include AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and Bit Shifts.

AND, for example, takes two sets of bits. For each pair of bits (two bits at the
same index in each set) it returns 1 _only if both_ bits are 1. Otherwise, it
returns 0. OR would return 1 if _either_ of the bits were 1.
