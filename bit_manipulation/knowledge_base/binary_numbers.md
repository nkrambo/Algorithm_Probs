Binary Numbers

When we use numbers, we usually use decimal numbers (or base-10), which are expressed using 10 values, 0-90âˆ’9.

So our digit columns increase by 10 times (11s, 1010s, 100100s). For example, let's take the digits 101101:



But using 10 values is arbitrary. We could multiply our columns by any number and numbers would still work. Some languages spoken in Nigeria and India use duodecimal numbers, or base-12. So "eleven" and "twelve" aren't built using 11s and 22s, they're entirely different digits.

Some mathematicians argue that base-12 is a better system than our base-10, because 12 has more factors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6) than 10 does (1, 2, 5). We probably use decimal numbers because we have 10 fingers.

Binary numbers (or base-2) only use two values, 00 and 11. So binary digit columns increase by 2 times (11s, 22s, 44s).

Let's look at the same digits 101101:

Binary numbers are nice for computers because they can easily be expressed as series of bits, which only have two states (think of them as "on" or "off", "open" or "closed", or 00 or 11).

Here are the base-10 numbers 00 through 1010 in binary:
