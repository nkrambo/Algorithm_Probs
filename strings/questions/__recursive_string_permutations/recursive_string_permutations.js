/**
* Recursive String Permutations
*
* Write a recursive function for generating all permutations of an input string.
* Return them as a set. Don't worry about time or space complexity—if we wanted
* efficiency we'd write an iterative version.
*
* To start, assume every character in the input string is unique.
*
* Your function can have loops—it just needs to also be recursive.
