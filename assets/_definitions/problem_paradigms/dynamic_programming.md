## Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (abbreviated as DP) is perhaps the most challenging problem-solving technique among the four paradigms discussed.

The key skills that you have to develop in order to master DP are the abilities to deter- mine the problem states and to determine the relationships or transitions between current problems and their sub-problems. These are covered with recursive backtracking approaches, see complete_search.md.

In fact, DP problems with small input size constraints may already be solvable with recursive backtracking.
