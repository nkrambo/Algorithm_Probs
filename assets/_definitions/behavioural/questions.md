### What do you think of Airbnb?

### Share one of your trips with us?

The most significant travel experience of my life is probably my first.

I was the first member in my family, 3 siblings and my parents, to travel outside of Australia. This was kind of a big deal at the time. I was 20 and boarded a flight to the U.S with my best mate. We had visas for 4 months to work in the U.S while we were on study break. We had no plan when we got off the flight in Los Angeles.

After a few days partying, we ended up heading to Aspen for the winter. Once I got there I got a job working on a dude ranch guiding tourists on snow mobiles to the Maroon Bells mountain range. I lived in a tiny remote cabin, buried in the snow, on the ranch with a pot-belly fire place and a deck of cards for entertainment. I worked amongst some great guys either my age are a little older who were all living a transient mountain lifestyle. I had so many great first experiences on this trip and made life-long friends. I found love for the mountains, snow and ultimately travel and adventure. I was hooked.

Since then, travel has been a major part of life and I have spent more of my adult life overseas than at home, in Australia. I believe it is one of the most rewarding gifts you can give yourself and I plan on seeing and experience as much as possible in my lifetime. I also feel very privileged to have been able to see as much as I have.

### How would you be able to survive a plane crash?

### What would your peers/ex-coworkers say is the biggest misconception about you?

### What food that you recently had made you emotional?

Vegemite... Missing home.

### How do you feel about monotonous, boring tasks?

If they can be automated then they should be. Are they wasting time? If they need to get done to work toward the completion of a project then they've got to be done by someone, even if they're boring.

### What was your worst travel moment? What happened?



### Teach me a skill I do not already know in 3 minutes.

Sailing knots?

### When you walk into a room, what would be your theme song?

Either the theme song from 'Beverly Hills Cop' or 'Danger Zone' by Kenny Loggins.

### How would you prefer to explain a situation: With words or a picture?

It depends on the situation. Some situations, like a conversation between people, would be better in words. Other situations might be better in pictures, such as plan layouts.

### Tell me a joke?

What did one snowman say to the other?... Do you smell carrot!?

Why do divers fall backwards out of a boat?... Because if they fell forwards they would land in the boat.

### What is the craziest idea you've ever had?

One day I plan to sail the world while working remotely from my boat.

### Why are manhole covers round?

* Easier to roll.
* No pointed edges to harm someone.
* A rounded cover cannot fall into a round hole but a square can. Could be a safety feature especially if you're inside coming out of the manhole.
* Minimizes area needed to fit person through, so saves materials.
