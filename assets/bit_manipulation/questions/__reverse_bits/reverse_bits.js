/**
* Reverse Bits
*
* Types: Bit Manipulation
*
* Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.
*
* Example:
* Input: 43261596 (represented in binary as 00000010100101000001111010011100)
* Output: 964176192 (represented in binary as 00111001011110000010100101000000)
*
* Follow up:
* If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
*
* Time: O(1)
* Space: O(1)
*
* @param {number} num 32-bit unsigned integer
* @return {number} Returns the reversed of num
