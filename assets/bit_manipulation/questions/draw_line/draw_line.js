/**
* Draw Line
*
* A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive
* pixels to be stored in one byte. The screen has width w, where w is divisible by 8
* (that is, no byte will be split across rows). The height of the screen, of course,
* can be derived from the length of the array and the width. Implement a function that
* draws a horizontal line from (x1, y) to (x2, y).
*
* The method signature should look something like:
* drawLine(screen, width, x1, x2, y)
*
* Solution:
