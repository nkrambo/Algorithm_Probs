/**
* Convert Number to Hexadecimal
*
* Types: Bit Manipulation
*
* Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative
* integer, two's complement method is used.
*
* Note:
*
* 1. All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
*
* 2. The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is
*    zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0'; otherwise, the first
*    character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
*
* 3. The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
*
* 4. You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats
*    the number to hex directly.
*
* Example:
* Input: 26
* Output: '1a'
*
* Example:
* Input: -1
* Output: 'ffffffff'
*
* Time: O(1)
* Space: O(1)
*
* @param {number} num 32-bit integer
* @return {string} Returns the hexadecimal value of num
