/**
* Single Number III
*
* Types: Bit Manipulation
*
* Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once
* and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that
* appear only once.
*
* Example:
* Input: [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5]
* Output: [3, 5]
*
* Note:
*
* 1. The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is
*    also correct.
*
* 2. Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement
*    it using only constant space complexity?
*
* Time: O(1)
* Space: O(1)
*
* @param {array} array of numbers all appearing twice, except 2 numbers appearing once
* @return {array} Returns an array of the values appearing once
