* Repeated DNA Sequences
*
* Tags: Bit Manipulation
* Leetcode: 187
*
* All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T,
* for example: 'ACGAATTCCG'. When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify
* repeated sequences within the DNA.
*
* Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur
* more than once in a DNA molecule.
*
* Example:
*
* Input: 'AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT'
* Output: ['AAAAACCCCC', 'CCCCCAAAAA']
