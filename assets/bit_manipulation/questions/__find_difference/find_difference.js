* Find the Difference
*
* Types: Bit Manipulation
*
* Given two strings s1 and s2 which consist of only lowercase letters.
*
* String s2 is a random shuffling of string s1 but with one more letter at a
* random position.
*
* Find the random letter that was added in s2.
*
* Example:
* Input: 'abcd', 'abcde'
* Output: 'e'
* 'e' is the letter that was added.
*
* Time: O(1)
* Space: O(1)
*
* @param {string} s1 string of n length
* @param {string} s2 a random shuffling of s1 with an additional random letter
* @return {number} Returns the random letter from s2
