/**
* Deck of Cards
*
* Design the data structures for a generic deck of cards. Explain how you would
* subclass the data structures to implement Blackjack.
*
* Solution:
*
* With any object oriented design questions, you will want to clarify some details
* about the question so you head off in the right direction in your solution.
*
* We'll assume that the interviewer means that a 'generic' deck of cards means a
* standard 52 card deck, like used to play poker or Blackjack, and not something
* like an Uno deck, for example.
