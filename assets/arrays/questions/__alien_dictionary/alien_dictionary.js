* There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order
* among letters are unknown to you. You receive a list of words from the dictionary,
* where words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language.
* Derive the order of letters in this language.

* For example, given the following words in dictionary:
*
* [
*   'wrt',
*   'wrf',
*   'er',
*   'ett',
*   'rftt'
* ]
*
* The correct order is: 'wertf'.
*
* Notes:
*
* 1. You may assume all letters are in lowercase.
* 2. If the order is invalid, return an empty string.
* 3. There may be multiple valid order of letters, return any one of them is fine.
*
* Time: O(1)
* Space: O(1)
