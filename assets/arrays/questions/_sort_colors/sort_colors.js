* Leetcode: 75
*
* Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so that objects
* of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
*
* Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white,
* and blue respectively.
*
* Follow up:
*
* A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
*
* First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite
* array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
*
* Could you come up with an one-pass algorithm using only constant space?
