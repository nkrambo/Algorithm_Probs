* Sort Colors
*

* of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
*
* Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white,
* and blue respectively.
*
* Time: O(1)
* Space: O(1)
*
* @param {array} arr of objects colored by integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
* @return {array} returns the same array sorted by colors
