* Tags: Array, Two Pointers
* Leetcode: 11
*
* Given n non-negative integers a{1}, a{2}, ... a{n}, where each represents a point
* at coordinate (i, a{i}). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints
* of line i is at (i, a{i}) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together x-axis forms
* a container, such that the container contains the most water.
*
* Note:
*
* You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.
