##Divide and Conquer

Divide and Conquer (abbreviated as D&C) is a problem-solving paradigm in which a problem is made *simpler* by 'dividing' it into smaller parts and then conquering each part.

The steps:
1. Divide the original problem into sub-problems—usually by half or nearly half,
2. Find (sub)-solutions for each of these sub-problems—which are now easier,
3. If needed, combine the sub-solutions to get a complete solution for the main problem.

The Divide and Conquer paradigm is usually utilized through popular algorithms that rely on it: Binary Search and its variants, Merge/Quick/Heap Sort, and data structures: Binary Search Tree, Heap, Segment Tree, Fenwick Tree, etc. The most commonly used form of the Divide and Conquer paradigm in technical interviews is the **Binary Search Principle**. If you want to do well in technical interviews, spend time practicing the various ways to apply it.

We use the term 'binary search principle' to refer to the D&C approach of halving the range of possible answers. The 'binary search algorithm' (finding index of an item in a sorted array), the 'bisection method' (finding the root of a function), and 'binary search the answer', are all instances of this principle.

###Binary Search Algorithm

###Bisection Method
We have discussed the applications of Binary Searches in finding items in static sorted sequences. However, the binary search principle can also be used to find the root of a function that may be difficult to compute directly.
