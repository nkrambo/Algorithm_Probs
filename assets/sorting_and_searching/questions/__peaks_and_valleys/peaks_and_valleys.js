/**
* Peaks and Valleys
*
* In an array of integers, a 'peak' is an element which is greater than or
* equal to the adjacent integers and a 'valley' is an element which is less
* than or equal to the adjacent integers. For example, in the array [5, 8, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6],
* [8, 6] are peaks and [5, 2] are valleys. Given an array of integers, sort the array into an
* alternating sequence of peaks and valleys.
*
* Example:
* Input: [5, 3, 1, 2, 3]
* Output: [5, 1, 3, 2, 3]
