* Stacks
*
* Stacks are similar to lists in that they have an order, but they limit you
* to only pushing and popping values at the end of the list, which as we saw
* before are very fast operations when mapping directly to memory.
*
* However, Stacks can also be implemented with other data structures in order
* to add functionality to them.
*
* The most common usage of stacks is places where you have one process adding
* items to the stack and another process removing them from the endâ€“
* prioritizing items added most recently.
*
