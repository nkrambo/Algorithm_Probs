/**
* Stacks
*
* The stack data structure is precisely what it sounds like: a stack of data. In
* certain types of problems, it can be favourable to store data in a stack rather
* than an array.
*
* A stack uses LIFO (last-in first out) ordering. That is, as in a stack of dinner
* plates, the most recent item added to the stack is the first item to be removed.
*
* The most common usage of stacks is places where you have one process adding
* items to the stack and another process removing them from the endâ€“
* prioritizing items added most recently.
*
* Key Operations:
*
* pop:  O(1)
* push: O(1)
* peek: O(1)
*/
