/**
* AVL Tree
*
* The AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. In an AVL tree, the heights
* of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one.
*
* AVL trees are often compared with red–black trees. AVL trees are more rigidly
* balanced than red–black trees, leading to faster retrieval but slower insertion
* and deletion.
*
* Therefore, for 'lookup-intensive' applications, AVL trees are better. For 'real-time'
* applications, red-black trees are better.
*
* Key Operations:
*
* get:    O(log n)
* add:    O(log n)
* remove: O(log n)
