* Leetcode: 308
*
* Given a 2D matrix matrix, find the sum of the elements inside the rectangle defined
* by its upper left corner (row1, col1) and lower right corner (row2, col2).
*
* Your class must include a sumRegion method, which takes (row1, col1, row2, col2).
*
* It should also have a update method, which takes (row, column, value).
*
* Example:
*
*   3 0 1 4 2
*   5 6 3 2 1
*   1 2 0 1 5
*   4 1 0 1 7
*   1 0 3 0 5
*
* sumRegion(2, 1, 4, 3) -> 8
* update(3, 2, 2)
* sumRegion(2, 1, 4, 3) -> 10
*
* Note:
*
* 1. The matrix is only modifiable by the update function.
*
* 2. You may assume the number of calls to update and sumRegion function is
*    distributed evenly.
*
* 3. You may assume that row1 ≤ row2 and col1 ≤ col2.
