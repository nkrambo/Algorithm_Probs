* Given a 2D board and a list of words from the dictionary, find all words in the
* board.

* "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter
* cell may not be used more than once in a word.
*

*
* Given words = ['oath', 'pea', 'eat', 'rain'], and the following board:
*
*   o a a n
*   e t a e
*   i h k r
*   i f l v
*
