* Count of Range Sum
*
* Tags: BST
* Leetcode: 327
*
* Given an integer array nums, return the number of range sums that lie in
* [lower, upper] inclusive. Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of the elements
* in nums between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.
*
* Note:
*
* A naive algorithm of O(n2) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.
*
* Example:
*
* Given nums = [-2, 5, -1], lower = -2, upper = 2
* Return 3.
*
* The three ranges are : [0, 0], [2, 2], [0, 2] and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.
