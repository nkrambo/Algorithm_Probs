* Count of Smaller Numbers After Self
*
* Tags: BST, Fenwick Tree, Segment Tree
* Leetcode: 315
*
* You are given an integer array nums and you have to return a new counts array.
* The counts array has the property where counts[i] is the number of smaller
* elements to the right of nums[i].
*
* Example:
*
* Given nums = [5, 2, 6, 1]
*
* - To the right of 5 there are 2 smaller elements (2 and 1).
* - To the right of 2 there is only 1 smaller element (1).
* - To the right of 6 there is 1 smaller element (1).
* - To the right of 1 there is 0 smaller element.
*
* Return [2, 1, 1, 0]
