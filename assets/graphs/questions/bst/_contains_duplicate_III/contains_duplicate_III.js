* Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices i
* and j in the array such that the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j]
* is at most t and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.
*
* In other words, we're looking for a close neighbouring index and a close value
* at that index, including actual duplicates.
