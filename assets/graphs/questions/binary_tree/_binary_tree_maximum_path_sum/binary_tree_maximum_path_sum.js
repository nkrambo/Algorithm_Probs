* Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
*
* Tags: Tree, DFS
* Leetcode: 124
*
* Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.
*
* For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting
* node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must
* contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.
*
* For example:
*
* Given the below binary tree,
*
*                  1
*               ↙     ↘
*             2         3
*
* Return 6.
