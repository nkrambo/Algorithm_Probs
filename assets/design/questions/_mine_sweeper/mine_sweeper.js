/**
* Mine Sweeper
*
* Design and implement a text-based Minesweeper game.
*
* Minesweeper is the classic computer game where am NxN grid has B mines (or bombs)
* hidden across the grid.
*
* The remaining cells are either blank or have a number behind them. The numbers reflect
* the number of bombs in the surrounding 8 cells.
*
* The user then uncovers a cell. If it is a bomb, the player loses. If it is a number,
* the number is exposed. If it is a blank cell, this cell and adjacent blank cells
* (up to and including the surrounding numeric cells) are exposed.
*
* The player wins when all non-bomb cells are exposed. The player can also flag
* certain places as potential bombs. This doesn't affect game play, other than
* to block the player from accidentally clicking a cell that is thought to have a bomb.
