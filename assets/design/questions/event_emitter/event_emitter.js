/**
* Write an emitter class:
*
* emitter = new Emitter();
*
* 1. Support subscribing to events.
*
* sub = emitter.subscribe('event_name', callback);
* sub2 = emitter.subscribe('event_name', callback2);
*
* 2. Support emitting events.
*
* This particular example should lead to the `callback` above being invoked with
* `foo` and `bar` as parameters. emitter.emit('event_name', foo, bar);
*
* 3. Support unsubscribing existing subscriptions by releasing them.
*
* sub.release(); // `sub` is the reference returned by `subscribe` above
*
* There is a lot of different implementations for different purposes of the Event
* Emitter pattern, but the basic idea is to provide a framework for managing events
* and to be able subscribes to them.
*
* The event emitter uses the so called "observer pattern".
*
* Basically, there is a central event emitter object which has multiple attached
* "observer" objects. These observers are notified whenever the state of the central
* object is changed. This pattern can easily be implemented using events.
*
* In fact, if you use jQuery or Vue.js or any other client-side library, they all
* use the concept of events in one way or another. This includes both standard DOM
* events, such as mouse clicks, and custom events defined by your components.
*
* If you use a tool such as Webpack or Browserify to bundle your client-side code,
* you can also use the EventEmitter class which works in the same way as the one
* provided by Node.js.
*
* The following Emitter class would allow implementations such as the following:
*
* let input = document.querySelector('input[type="text"]');
* let button = document.querySelector('button');
* let h1 = document.querySelector('h1');
* let emitter = new EventEmitter();
*
* emitter.subscribe('event:name-changed', data => {
*   h1.innerHTML = `Your name is: ${data.name}`;
* });
*
* button.addEventListener('click', () => {
*   emitter.emit('event:name-changed', {name: input.value});
* });
