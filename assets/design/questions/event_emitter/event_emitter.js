/**
* Write an emitter class:
*
* emitter = new Emitter();
*
* 1. Support listening to events.
*
* listen = emitter.addListener('event_type', callback);
* listen2 = emitter.addListener('event_type', callback2);
*
* 2. Support emitting events.
*
* This particular example should lead to the `callback` above being invoked with
* `foo` and `bar` as parameters. emitter.emit('event_type', foo, bar);
*
* 3. Support unsubscribing existing listeners by removing them.
*
* listen.remove(); // `listen` is the reference returned by `listen` above
*
* There is a lot of different implementations for different purposes of the Event
* Emitter pattern, but the basic idea is to provide a framework for managing events
* and to be able listen to them.
*
* The event emitter uses the so called "observer pattern".
*
* Basically, there is a central event emitter object which has multiple attached
* "observer" objects. These observers are notified whenever the state of the central
* object is changed. This pattern can easily be implemented using events.
*
* In fact, if you use jQuery or Vue.js or any other client-side library, they all
* use the concept of events in one way or another. This includes both standard DOM
* events, such as mouse clicks, and custom events defined by your components.
*
* If you use a tool such as Webpack or Browserify to bundle your client-side code,
* you can also use the EventEmitter class which works in the same way as the one
* provided by Node.js.
*
* The following Emitter class would allow implementations such as the following:
*
* const token = emitter.addListener('change', (...args) => {
*   console.log(...args);
* });
*
* emitter.emit('change', 10); // 10 is logged
* token.remove();
* emitter.emit('change', 10); // nothing is logged
*

*
* A more practical example:
*
* let input = document.querySelector('input[type="text"]');
* let button = document.querySelector('button');
* let h1 = document.querySelector('h1');
*
* let emitter = new Emitter();
*
* emitter.addListener('name-changed', data => {
*   h1.innerHTML = `Your name is: ${data.name}`;
* });
*
* button.addEventListener('click', () => {
*   emitter.emit('name-changed', { name: input.value });
* });
