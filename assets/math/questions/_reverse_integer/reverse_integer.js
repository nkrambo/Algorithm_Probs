* Reverse Integer

*
* Reverse digits of an integer.
*
* Example 1:
*
* Given 123
* Return 321
*
* Example 2:
*
* Given -123
* Return -321
*
* Have you thought about this?
*
* Here are some good questions to ask before coding. Bonus points for you if you
* have already thought through this!
*
* If the integer's last digit is 0, what should the output be? ie, cases such as
* 10, 100.
*
* Did you notice that the reversed integer might overflow? Assume the input is a
* 32-bit integer, then the reverse of 1000000003 overflows. How should you handle
* such cases?
*
* For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the
* reversed integer overflows.
*
* Note:
*
* The input is assumed to be a 32-bit signed integer. Your function should return
* 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
