* Palindrome Number

* Tags: Math
* Leetcode: 9
*
* Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.
*
* Some hints:
*
* Could negative numbers be palindromes? (ie, -1)
*
* If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction
* of using extra space.
*
* You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem
* "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might overflow. How would
* you handle such a case?
*
* There is a more generic way of solving this problem.
