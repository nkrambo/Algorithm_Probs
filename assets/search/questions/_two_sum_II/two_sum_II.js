* Two Sum II
*
* Tags: Binary Search
* Leetcode: 167
*
* Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two
* numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
*
* The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add
* up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your
* returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
*
* You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not
* use the same element twice.
*
* Example:
*
* nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
* Returns [1, 2]
