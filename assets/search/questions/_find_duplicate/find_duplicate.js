* Find The Duplicate Number
*
* Tags: Binary Search
* Leetcode: 287
*
* Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1
* and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume
* that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.
*
* Note:
*
* 1. You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
*
* 2. You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
*
* 3. Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n^2).
*
* 4. There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated
*    more than once.
