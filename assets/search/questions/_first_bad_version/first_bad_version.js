/**
* First Bad Version
*
* Tags: Binary Search
* Leetcode: 278
*
* You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product.
* Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since
* each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after
* a bad version are also bad.
*
* Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first
* bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
*
* You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version
* is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize
* the number of calls to the API.
