* Kth Smallest in a BST
*
* Tags: Binary Search
* Leetcode: 230
*
* Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest
* element in it.
*
* Note:
*
* You may assume k is always valid, 1 ? k ? BST's total elements.
*
* Follow up:
*
* What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find
* the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?
