*
* A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in
* the diagram below).
*
* The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot
* is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the
* diagram below).
*
* How many possible unique paths are there?
