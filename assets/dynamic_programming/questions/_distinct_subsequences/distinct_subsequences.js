* Distinct Subsequences

*
* Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of
* S which equals T.
*
* A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string
* by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative
* positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE"
* while "AEC" is not).
*
* Here is an example:
*
* S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
* Return 3.
