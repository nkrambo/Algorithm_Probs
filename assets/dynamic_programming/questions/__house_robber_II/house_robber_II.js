* After robbing those houses on that street, the thief has found himself a new
* place for his thievery so that he will not get too much attention. This time,
* all houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house
* is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, the security system for these houses
* remain the same as for those in the previous street.
*
* Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each
* house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting
* the police.
