* Paint Fill
*
* Implement the 'paint fill' function that one might see on many image editing
* programs. That is, given a screen (represented by a two-dimensional array of
* colors), a point, and a new color, fill in the surrounding area until the color
* changes from the original color.
*
* Solution:
*
* Time: O(1)
* Space: O(1)
*
* @param {array} screen two-dimensional array of colors
* @param {array} point [x, y] screen co-ordinate
* @param {string} color string representation of a color
* @return {array} returns array of strings of all permutations
