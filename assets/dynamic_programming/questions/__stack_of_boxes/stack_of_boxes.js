/**
* Stack of Boxes
*
* You have a stack of n boxes, with widths w(i), heights h(i), and depths d(i).
* The boxes cannot be rotated and can only be stacked on top of one another if
* each box in the stack is strictly larger than the box above it in width, height,
* and depth. Implement a function to compute the height of the tallest possible
* stack. The height of a stack is the sum of the heights of each box.
*
* Solution:
*
* Time: O(1)
* Space: O(1)
*
* @param {string} string of unique characters
* @return {array} returns array of strings of all permutations
