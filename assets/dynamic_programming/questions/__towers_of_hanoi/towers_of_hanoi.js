* Towers of Hanoi
*
* In this classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers and n disks
* of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with the
* disks sorted in ascending of size from the top to bottom (i.e, each disk sits
* on top of an even larger one). You have the following constraints:
*
* 1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
* 2. A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto another tower.
* 3. A disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
*
* Write a program to move the disks from the first tower to the last using stacks.
*
* Solution:
*
* Time: O(1)
* Space: O(1)
*
* @param {integer} n disks
* @param {object} origin tower class
* @param {object} destination tower class
* @param {object} buffer tower class
* @return {void} modifies tower classes
