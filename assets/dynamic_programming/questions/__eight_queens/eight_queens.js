* Eight Queens
*
* Write an algorithm to print all ways of arranging eight queens on an 8x8 chess
* board so that none of them share the same row, column, or diagonal. In this case,
* 'diagonal' means all diagonals, not just the two that bisect the board.
*
* Solution:
*
* Time: O(1)
* Space: O(1)
*
* @param {number} row board row number
* @param {array} columns array of board columns
* @param {array} results array of results
* @return {array} returns a board matrix with queen placements marked with an 'X'
