* Gas Station

*
* You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel
* from station i to its next station (i + 1). You begin the journey with an empty
* tank at one of the gas stations.
*
* Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once,
* otherwise return -1.

* Note:

* The solution is guaranteed to be unique.
