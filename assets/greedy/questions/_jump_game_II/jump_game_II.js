/**
* Jump Game II
*
* Types: Greedy
*
* Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the
* first index of the array.
*
* Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
*
* Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
*
* Example:
*
* Given [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]
* Return 2
* Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index
*
* Note:
*
* You can assume that you can always reach the last index.
