/**
* Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
*
* Tags: Greedy, Array, Dynamic Programming
* Leetcode: 121
*
* Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock
* on day i.
*
* If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and
* sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
*
* Example 1:
*
* Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
* Output: 5
*
* max. difference = 6-1 = 5 (not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger
* than buying price)
*
* Example 2:
*
* Input: [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
* Output: 0
*
* In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
*/

/**
* maxProfitBrute()
*
* Solution:
*
* We need to find out the maximum difference (which will be the maximum profit)
* between two numbers in the given array. Also, the second number (selling price)
* must be larger than the first one (buying price).
*
* In formal terms, we need to find max(prices[j] âˆ’ prices[i]), for every i
* and j such that j > i.
*
* Time: O(n^2)
* Space: O(1)
*
* We get a quadratic time complexity. We can do much better than this. We can
* actually do this in O(n).
*
* @param {number[]} prices
* @return {number}

/**
* maxProfit()
*
* Solution:
*
* We'll greedily walk through the array to track the max profit and lowest
* price so far.
*
* Say the given array is:
*
* [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
*
* If we plot the numbers of the given array on a graph, we get:

* The points of interest are the peaks and valleys in the given graph. We need to
* find the largest peak following the smallest valley. We can maintain two variables,
* minprice and maxprofit corresponding to the smallest valley and maximum profit
* (maximum difference between selling price and minprice) obtained so far respectively.
*
* For every price, we check if:
*
* - we can get a better profit by buying at minPrice and selling at the currentPrice
* - we have a new minPrice
*
* To start, we initialize:
*
* 1. minPrice as the first price of the day
* 2. maxProfit as the first profit we could get
*
* What happens if the price decreases all day? In this case, we should return 0
* but we could have also thrown an error or even returned a negative profit margin.

* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(1)

* We only loop through the array once.
