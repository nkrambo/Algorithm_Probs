/**
* Text Justification
*
* Given an array of words and a length L, format the text such that each line
* has exactly L characters and is fully (left and right) justified.
*
* You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words
* as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line
* has exactly L characters.
*
* Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the
* number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots
* on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.
*
* For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is
* inserted between words.
*
* Example:
*
* Input: ['This', 'is', 'an', 'example', 'of', 'text', 'justification'.], 16
* Output: ['This    is    an',
*          'example  of text',
*          'justification.  ']
*
* Note: Each word is guaranteed not to exceed len in length.
