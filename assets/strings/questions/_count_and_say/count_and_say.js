* Count and Say
*
* Tags: String
* Leetcode: 38
*
* The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:
*
* 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ...
*
* 1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
* 11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
* 21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.
*
* Given an integer n, generate the nth sequence.
*
* Note:
*
* The sequence of integers will be represented as a string.
