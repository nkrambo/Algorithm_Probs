* Longest Substring With at Least K Repeating Characters
*
* Tags: String
* Leetcode: 395
*
* Find the length of the longest substring T of a given string (consists of
* lowercase letters only) such that every character in T appears no less than k times.
*
* Example 1:
*
* Input: str: 'aaabb', k: 3
* Output: 3
* The longest substring is 'aaa', as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
*
* Example 2:
*
* Input: str: 'ababbc', k: 2
* Output: 5
* The longest substring is 'ababb', as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
