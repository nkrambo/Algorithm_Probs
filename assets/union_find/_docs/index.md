## Union Find

A union–find data structure, also known as a disjoint-set or a merge–find set, is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. It supports two useful operations:

- **Find:** Determine which subset a particular element is in. Find typically returns an item from this set that serves as its "representative"; by comparing the result of two Find operations, one can determine whether two elements are in the same subset.

- **Union:** Join two subsets into a single subset.

Runtime and space complexity

Space: O(n) - average and worst
Find: O(a(n)) - average and worst
Union: O(a(n)) - average and worst
