* Leetcode: 130
*
* Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions
* surrounded by 'X'.
*
* A region is captured by flipping all Os into Xs in that surrounded region.
*
* Example:
*
* X X X X
* X O O X
* X X O X
* X O X X
*
* Will return:
*
* X X X X
* X X X X
* X X X X
* X O X X
