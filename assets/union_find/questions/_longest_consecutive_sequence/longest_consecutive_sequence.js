* Longest Consecutive Sequence
*
* Tags: Union Find
*
* Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive
* elements sequence.
*
* Example:
*
* [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
*
* The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.
*
* Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
