* Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph
*
* Tags: Union Find
*
* Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge
* is a pair of nodes), write a function to find the number of connected components
* in an undirected graph.
*
* Example 1:
*
*   0          3
*   |          |
*   1 --- 2    4
*
* Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]], return 2.
*
* Example 2:
*
*   0           4
*   |           |
*   1 --- 2 --- 3
*
* Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]], return 1.
*
* Note:
*
* You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are
* undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.
