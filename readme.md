# Javascript Interview Material

If you're like me, you spend most of your time working with full-stack JavaScript.

This repository is a collection of common algorithms, data structures and interview
questions, written in JavaScript.

It's a running collection made up from several resources. It was meant as a personal
learning reference, for material I had covered, but it might be valuable for others
working in JavaScript heavy roles or preparing for a technical interview in a JavaScript
role.

Contributions are more than welcome, if you have anything to add. Please read the
contributing.md for details.

If you're preparing for a technical interview, again, this is meant only as a reference.
I personally think there is little value in reading a solution without attempting
a question thoroughly first.
