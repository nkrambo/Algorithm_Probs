""" Stack of Plates: Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets
    too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a
    new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data
    structure setOfStacks that mimics this. setOfStacks should be composed of
    several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds
    capacity. setOfStacks.push() and setOfStacks.pop() should behave identically
    to a single stack (that is, pop() should return the same values as it would if
    there were just a single stack)."""

""" Follow Up: Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation
    on a specific sub-stak."""
