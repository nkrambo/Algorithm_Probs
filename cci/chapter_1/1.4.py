""" Palindrome permutation: Given a string, write a function to
    check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word
    or phrase that is the same forwards as it is backwards. A permutation is a
    rearrangment of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just
    dictionary words."""

# input - 'Tact Coa'
