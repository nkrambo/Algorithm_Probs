/**
* Split Arary Largest Sum
*
* Given an array which consists of non-negative integers and an integer m, you
* can split the array into m non-empty continuous subarrays. Write an algorithm
* to minimize the largest sum among these m subarrays.
*
* Example:
* Input: [7, 2, 5, 10, 8], 2
* Output: 18
* There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays. The best way is to split
* it into [7, 2, 5] and [10, 8], where the largest sum among the two subarrays
* is only 18.
