/**
* In-Flight Entertainment
*
* You've built an in-flight entertainment system with on-demand movie streaming.
*
* Users on longer flights like to start a second movie right when their first one
* ends, but they complain that the plane usually lands before they can see the ending.
* So you're building a feature for choosing two movies whose total runtimes will
* equal the exact flight length.
*
* Write a function that takes an integer flightLength (in minutes) and an array
* of integers movieLengths (in minutes) and returns a boolean indicating whether
* there are two numbers in movieLengths whose sum equals flightLength.
*
* When building your function:
*
* - Assume your users will watch exactly two movies
* - Don't make your users watch the same movie twice
* - Optimize for runtime over memory
