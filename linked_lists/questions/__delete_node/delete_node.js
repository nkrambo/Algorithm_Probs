* Delete Node
*
* Delete a node from a singly-linked list, given only a variable pointing to that node.
*
* The input could, for example, be the variable b below:
*
* function LinkedListNode(value) {
*   this.value = value;
*   this.next = null;
* }
*
* let a = new LinkedListNode('A');
* let b = new LinkedListNode('B');
* let c = new LinkedListNode('C');
*
* a.next = b;
* b.next = c;
*
* deleteNode(b);

/**
* deleteNode()
*
* Solution:
*
* We don't know what the head of the list is, we only have a reference to the
* node we want to delete. So we can't traverse the list.
*
* When you think about how we normally 'delete' a node from a linked-list, we
* just change the previous node's pointer to skip the node we want to delete.
*
* But, in this case, we don't even have access to the previous node either.
*
* So what we do is modify the current node instead of deleting it.
*
* We take the value and next from the input node's next node and copy them into
* the input node. Now the input node's previous node effectively skips the input
* node's old value! Pretty easy!
*
* A couple of things to consider.
*
* First, it doesn't work for deleting the last node in the list. We could change
* the node we're deleting to have a value of null, but the second-to-last node's
* next pointer would still point to a node, even though it should be null.
* This could workâ€”we could treat this last, 'deleted' node with value null as a
* 'dead node' or a 'sentinel node', and adjust any node traversing code to stop
* traversing when it hits such a node. The trade-off there is we couldn't have
* non-dead nodes with values set to null. Instead we chose to throw an exception
* in this case.
*
* Second, this method can cause some unexpected side-effects. For example,
* let's say we call:
*
* let a = new LinkedListNode(3);
* let b = new LinkedListNode(8);
* let c = new LinkedListNode(2);
*
* a.next = b;
* b.next = c;
*
* deleteNode(b);
*
* There are two potential side-effects:
*
* 1. Any references to the input node have now effectively been reassigned to its
*    next node. In our example, we 'deleted' the node assigned to the variable b,
*    but in actuality we just gave it a new value (2) and a new next! If we had
*    another pointer to b somewhere else in our code and we were assuming it still
*    had its old value (8), that could cause bugs.
*
* 2. If there are pointers to the input node's original next node, those pointers
*    now point to a 'dangling' node (a node that's no longer reachable by walking
*    down our list). In our example above, c is now dangling. If we changed c, we'd
*    never encounter that new value by walking down our list from the head to the tail.
*
* Time: O(1)
* Space: O(1)
*
* @param {string} str string of (n) length
* @return {boolean} returns true if all characters in string are unique
