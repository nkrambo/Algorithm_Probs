// First common ancestor

// Design an algorithm and write code to find  the first common ancestor of two nodes in
// a binary tree. Avoid storing additional nodes in a data structure.
// NOTE: This is not necessarily a BST

// with node links to parents
function commonAncestorWithParents(p, q) {

}

// with no links to parents
function commonAncestor(p, q) {

}
