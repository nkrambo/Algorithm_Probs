/**
* Make Change
*
* Your quirky boss found out that you're a programmer and has a weird
* request about something they've been wondering for a long time.
*
* Write a function that, given: an amount of money, an array of coin denominations.
* Computes the number of ways to make amount of money with coins of
* the available denominations.
*
* Example: for amount = (4)cents and denominations = [1, 2, 3] (cents)
* your program would output 4 - the number of ways to make 4¢ with those denominations:
*
* 1¢, 1¢, 1¢, 1¢
* 1¢, 1¢, 2¢
* 1¢, 3¢
* 2¢, 2¢
*

* Solution:

* Space: O(n)
* Where n is the length of the string input.

* @param {number} amount amount of money to make change from
* @param {array} denominations array of available coin denominations
* @return {array} returns an array of arrays, with possible methods to make change
