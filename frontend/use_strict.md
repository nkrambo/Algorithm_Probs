**What is `"use strict";`? what are the advantages and disadvantages to using it?**

"use strict;" is applied to an entire script file or to individual functions by implementing at the beginning of a file or at the beginning of inside a function before anything else.

Main purpose of using strict mode is to be able to evaluate your JavaScript code and throw more errors in an effort to make your code more robust, readable, accurate and fixes compatibility issues that may arise for future JavaScript releases.

ES6 classes have use strict in-built.
