/**
* Temperature Tracker
*
* You decide to test if your oddly-mathematical heating company is fulfilling its
* All-Time Max, Min, Mean and Mode Temperature Guarantee™.
*
* Write a class TempTracker with these methods:
*
* 1. insert()—records a new temperature
* 2. getMax()—returns the highest temp we've seen so far
* 3. getMin()—returns the lowest temp we've seen so far
* 4. getMean()—returns the mean ↴ of all temps we've seen so far
* 5. getMode()—returns a mode ↴ of all temps we've seen so far
*
* Optimize for space and time. Favor speeding up the getter functions (getMax(),
* getMin(), getMean(), and getMode()) over speeding up the insert() function.
*
* Temperatures will all be inserted as integers. We'll record our temperatures
* in Fahrenheit, so we can assume they'll all be in the range 0..110.
*
* If there is more than one mode, return any of the modes.
