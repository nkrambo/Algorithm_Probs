// Rank from Stream

// Imagine you are reading in a stream of integers. Periodically, you wish to be able to
// look up the rank of a number x (the number of values less than or equal to x).
// Implement the data structures and algorithms to support these operations. That is,
// implement the method track(x), which is called when each number is generated, and
// the method getRankOfNumber(x), which returns the number of values less than or
// equal to x (not including x itself).

// EXAMPLE
// Stream (in order of apperance): 5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 9, 7, 13, 3

// getRankOfNumber(1) = 0
// getRankOfNumber(3) = 1
// getRankOfNumber(4) = 3

function track(x) {

}

function getRankOfNumber(x) {

}

export default getRankOfNumber;
